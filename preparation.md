>

## 🎓 3. LMS Product Overview (10–12 mins)

**🎙️ Manjunath:**
> So, coming to the LMS — our idea started with a simple observation:  
> Most LMS platforms today are built for students or coaching institutes, not for **schools as institutions**.  
>
> We’re building a **B2B LMS** where we onboard entire schools — including the administration body, headmasters, teachers, and students.  

**Structure & Workflow:**
- Once a school is onboarded, we collect their **daily class timetable**.  
- As soon as a chapter is completed, the system automatically releases **tests** for students.  
- This helps generate **student analytics** in real time — understanding performance, attendance patterns, and learning gaps.  
- Over time, we plan to integrate **AI-driven recommendations** for personalized learning and performance improvement.  

> We already have **3 schools** interested and ready to onboard once the product goes live.  
>
> The current product is in **active development**, and we can show a **Figma demo** during or after the call if needed.

## 🤖 4. Tech and AI Angle (2–3 mins)

**🎙️ Johnson (AI & Analytics Lead):**
> On the AI and analytics side, our focus is twofold:  
> - First, using **ML models** to analyze student test data and generate performance-based recommendations.  
> - Second, in the long term, we’re exploring **agentic AI integration** — where the system itself can interact with teachers and students, assisting with content and academic suggestions dynamically.  
>
> This will help schools move towards more **data-driven decision-making** while improving student outcomes.

---

## 💰 5. Business and Market Points (5–7 mins)

**🎙️ Achyuth:**
> In terms of market and business direction:  
> - We’ve done groundwork with schools in Karnataka — feedback is great. Schools want affordable LMS solutions made specifically for them, not generic edtech tools.  
> - Our **pricing model** will likely follow a **per-student, per-year** structure (SaaS model), with additional features like AI reports in premium tiers.  
> - Content is a major pillar — we’ll be covering **ICSE, CBSE, and State Board** syllabi, starting with the State syllabus for pilot schools.

---

## ⚙️ 6. Project Valuation & Cost (2–3 mins)

**🎙️ Manjunath or Achyuth:**
> The LMS is currently in the MVP development stage, so valuation will evolve as we roll out pilots.  
> The main cost centers are **tech development** (handled in-house) and **content creation**, which will require larger investment for scalable and high-quality material.

---

## 🤝 7. What We Expect from Aneesh (2–3 mins)

**🎙️ Achyuth or Manjunath:**
> We’re mainly looking for **strategic collaboration in content creation** — because building rich, syllabus-aligned content for ICSE, CBSE, and State boards needs both funding and strong academic networks.  
>
> Your experience and connections could really help us accelerate that part while we focus on the tech and delivery side.  
>
> Beyond content, we’d also love your guidance on **product-market fit**, **scaling**, and **go-to-market strategy** since you’ve been on that side of the journey before.

---

## 🚀 8. Wrap-Up (2–3 mins)

**🎙️ Manjunath:**
> Thanks, Aneesh — really appreciate your time and insights.  
> We’ll be sharing the Figma demo link and a short deck summarizing the LMS structure after the call.  
>
> Let’s keep this discussion open and explore what collaboration path makes sense for both sides.  

**🎙️ Achyuth:**
> Yes, totally — it was great sharing our vision.  
> We’re building something that can make a real difference for schools, and we’d love to have you associated in some way as we move forward.

## 🧠 Pro Tips for Delivery
✅ Keep it conversational — not like a pitch deck.  
✅ Let **Manjunath** set the tone, **Achyuth** lead the business & vision, and **Johnson** step in naturally when AI or analytics comes up.  
✅ Keep the call time within 30 minutes — short, confident, and clear.  
✅ Don’t open the full product — just Figma flow and vision discussion.
